## SuperMemo Assistant

**Work In Progress**. You can use [the legacy AHK version](https://github.com/supermemo/SuperMemoScripts) until then.

*SuperMemo Assistant* is a companion app for [SuperMemo 17](https://super-memo.com/supermemo17.html). It is an interface to **interact with SuperMemo**, and extend its functionalities through the **development of plugins**.

### How does it work ?

*SMA* (short for *SuperMemo Assistant*) acts like a chip on the central nervous system of *SuperMemo*. It monitors its internal state, and taps into the program's powerful code base to expose its main capabilities.

These capabilities are exposed through an API that developers can use.

### What can it do ?

Almost anything that *SuperMemo* itself can do:
- Create new elements (topics, items, ...),
- Change displayed content (html, images, ...)
- Navigate to new elements,
- Browse the Knowledge Tree,
- Review, reschedule, dismiss, or delete elements,
- etc.

In turn, plugins can use these functionalities to extend *SuperMemo* with new features (PDF incremental reading, LaTeX, dictionary, ...).

### Downloads

*SMA* will be announced soon.

### Installation and Usage
