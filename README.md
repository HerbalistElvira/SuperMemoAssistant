## SuperMemo Assistant

**Work In Progress**. You can use [the legacy AHK version](https://github.com/supermemo/SuperMemoScripts) until then.

*SuperMemo Assistant* is a companion app for [SuperMemo 17](https://super-memo.com/supermemo17.html). It is an interface to programmatically **interact with SuperMemo**, and extend its functionalities through the **development of plugins**.

### How does it work ?

*SMA* (short for *SuperMemo Assistant*) acts like a chip on the central nervous system of *SuperMemo*. It monitors its internal state, and taps into the program's powerful code base to expose its main capabilities.

In turn, they are exposed through an API that developers can use to build plugins.

### What can it do ?

Almost anything that *SuperMemo* itself can do:
- Create new elements (topics, items, ...),
- Change displayed content (html, images, ...)
- Navigate to new elements,
- Browse the Knowledge Tree,
- Review, reschedule, dismiss, or delete elements,
- etc.

Plugins use these functionalities to extend *SuperMemo* with new features (PDF incremental reading, LaTeX, dictionary, ...).

### Downloads
