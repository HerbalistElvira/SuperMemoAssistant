PSA: if you'd like to use SMA before the official release contact @Naess at supermemo discord channel https://discord.gg/pB7jcSK

*SuperMemo Assistant* is a companion app for [SuperMemo 17](https://super-memo.com/supermemo17.html).

Did you ever wish you could use **PDF** documents ? Or integrate **LaTeX** right into your SuperMemo ? *SMA* does all of this for you, and more !

### What can it do ?

Almost anything that *SuperMemo* itself can do:
- Create new elements (topics, items, ...),
- Change displayed content (html, images, ...)
- Navigate to new elements,
- Browse the Knowledge Tree,
- Review, reschedule, dismiss, or delete elements,
- etc.

Plugins use these functionalities to extend *SuperMemo* with new features (PDF incremental reading, LaTeX, dictionary, ...).

### How does it work ?

*SMA* acts like a chip on the central nervous system of *SuperMemo*. It monitors its internal state, and taps into the program's powerful code base to expose its main capabilities. They are then exposed through an API that developers can use to build plugins.

In short, SMA is an interface to programmatically **interact with SuperMemo**.

### Downloads

**Work In Progress**. You can use [the legacy AHK version](https://github.com/supermemo/SuperMemoScripts) until then.

### Installation and Usage

*SMA* will be announced soon.
